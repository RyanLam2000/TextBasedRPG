# TextBaasedRPG

This is a text based RPG I made in Spring of 2018.
It is entirely programmed in Java. The game was
designed using object oriented programming to make
it easy to update in the future. It includes a
random map generator (max size is 10x10 rooms), a
random item generator, and a random monster generator.

The game is run by running the Launcher class.
